##Credit

Most of the techinques and integrated knowledge comes from the lessons at Flatiron School, alongside some tidbits from MDN and some insight from Stack Overflow.

This small javascript app project was made utilizing "TheCocktailDB" api from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php.

Currently the api method used is the basic "search cocktail by name" such as https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita
